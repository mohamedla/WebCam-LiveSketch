# WebCam-LiveSketch
It is a simple use of OpenCV library to generate a live sketch video by transform it frame by frame

To run this app you must have Pyhton  on your device (I use Python 3.10.1 when work on it)

  and install couple of packges (used python pip to do it)

      terminal command :
      
        pip install opencv-python
        
        pip insall numpy
        
Now you ready to run the app

  just run from liveSketch.py file using your terminall or any editor you prefer that suports Python
  
Enjoy ;)
